This course provides lecture, lab, and studio components focused on the integrated relationship between architecture and the landscape.  The course views the landscape as a primary source of information for the making of architectural decisions about space, access, natural and built forms, and environmental soundness.  The course teaches fundamental design principles, ordering systems, site analysis, graphic research methods, architectural and landscape precedents, and graphic documentation skills.  The course builds on the skills addressed in the freshman studio courses, and prepares students to understand concepts of interior space and materials to be considered in ID2 and ID3.  The studio component emphasizes integrated architectural composition; the lab emphasizes exploration and experimentation with design media and other specific design inquiries in support of the studio.

This course provides lecture, lab and studio components focused on the integrated relationship between architecture and interior space. The course conceives interior space as the study of light, color, texture and volume as it relates to human scale. The course objectives and outcomes are organized into four phases; gathering, finding, transforming and synthesis - and includes studies on building program, daylight and the haptic study of material. The course builds on the concepts of landscape and site from the ID1 course and prepares students to embrace concepts of tectonics to be considered in ID3. The studio component emphasizes integrated architectural composition; the lab emphasizes exploration and experimentation with design media and other specific design inquiries in support of the studio.

The course objectives and outcomes are organized into four phases: elements, assemblies, applications, and synthesis.  Areas of focus include construction joints, sequencing, weathering, primary vs. secondary systems, and relationships of constituent parts to whole buildings.  The course builds on the concepts of landscape and site from the ID1 course, and interior and daylight from the ID2 course, and prepares students to embrace concepts of urban systems to be considered in ID4.  The studio component emphasizes integrated architectural composition; the lab emphasizes exploration and experimentation with design media and other specific design inquiries in support of the studio.

This course provides lecture, lab and studio components focused on the integrated relationship between architecture and urban design. The course conceives the city as a system of organized complexity and explores architectural and urban responses to complex multidimensional systems. Students examine critical forces and historical patterns using documentation and analysis, responding at multiple scales of building, site, neighborhood, city, and region through experimentation and synthesis. The course builds on the concepts of landscape and site from ID1, interior and daylight from ID2, and tectonics and materials from ID3, and prepares students to embrace concepts of public and community to be considered in ID5. The studio component emphasizes integrated architectural composition; the lab emphasizes exploration and experimentation with design media and other specific design inquiries in support of the studio.

Study Abroad: Europe is the core course in the undergraduate study abroad program at the College of Architecture and Design. Students spend four weeks immersed in the culture and history of a European city. The base city for the program is Paris but alternate years will explore other cultural centers including Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Barcelona, Rome, Athens and London. A comprehensive survey of architecture, urban design and history focused on the European city being visited. The course is divided into two sections. The first part of the program is focused on research and analysis of urban form and development. The second half studies the architecture, history, art, and culture of the host city through various methods. A travel break separates the two parts of the course and students are encouraged to explore surrounding countryside of other nearby cities. Study Abroad: Europe is a prerequisite for ARC4264 Allied Design Studio but may also be taken as a stand along elective. If the course is to be used as the prerequisite for the Allied Design Studio, the two courses must be registered simultaneously for sequential semesters (Summer/Fall). The format of the course is four (4) one week intensive study modules.

This course is the fifth in a sequence of five basic architectural design courses. This course consists of coordinated lecture, lab and studio components and focuses on the relationship between architecture and the public sphere: the varied, changing, and complex ways in which architecture influences and is influenced by people and public life. Students explore this relationship through the forces, patterns, and hierarchies that naturally define it, including matters of aesthetics, psychology, sociology, ecology, politics, and tectonics, with the aim of making sound and sustainable public design decisions. The course builds on the concepts of landscape and site from ID1, interior and daylight from ID2, tectonics and materials from ID3, urban responses from ID4, and prepares students to embrace concepts considered in Advanced Design Studios. The studio component emphasizes integrated architectural composition; the lab emphasizes exploration and experimentation with design media and other specific design inquiries in support of the studio.

Urbanized areas around the globe are increasingly becoming the focus of debate around sustainability.  The majority of the world's population now resides in Cities and their urbanized regions.  This figure is projected to be 75% by 2030.  This course will address how urban designers can and should go Â¿beyond the buildingÂ¿ to embrace a more balanced and holistic systems approach to design and policy initiatives for these critical centers of civilization.  This is to integrate them into and go beyond physical or environmental aspects of current notions of sustainable design, beyond the current popularity of narrowly focused rating systems (such as LEED ND) and single issues (such as energy). Building on the introduction to Sustainable Urbanism in the MUD Current Issues seminar, this course will address the complex environmental, economic, social, cultural, political, and ethical forces that affect City + Regional form.  The seminar will explore notable national and international precedents of integrated design strategies for Cities + Regions (Chicago, Portland, Freiburg, Curitiba, Barcelona, Emscher Park, et al).  Within this globalized context and broadened framework of sustainability, we will ask the students to define the meaning of sustainability in the context of cities and urban development.  Themes addressed will include: Citizenship: how will the need for sustainable urbanism create a new citizen for the 21st century?  What are the values/value systems that will drive the creation of sustainable place?  What will be the evolving role of the citizen from awareness and lifestyle changes to active role as designer and stewards of their environment Equity: addressing the imbalance between resource rich urbanized areas in low growth mode and those that are in high growth mode where resource scarcity exists.  How will equity play a role in providing for under-capitalized/served communities in determining resources allocation and accessibility?  Economics: focusing on strategic investments where and when do we invest within the city and region?  What will be the evolving role of the public and private sectors and partnerships?  Urban density is already an emerging result of such debates.  What sort of urban form will such policy and investment decisions drive?  Infrastructure: establishing a broadened notion of infrastructure the new ecosystem of the city including Â¿blue, green, and gray defined by water and marine resources, all aspects of the natural environment and built public realm, and the man-made technologies and infrastructure that will create future utilities and movement systems that will support mobility and accessibility.  How can we balance population growth and needs with the very real necessity of protecting increasingly fragile natural systems of the planet?  Measuring Sustainable Urbanism current metrics such as LEED are not suited to the scale of the city and region.  There is an emergent field investigation how can such rating systems be expanded and adapted (e.g. LAND, BREEAM, et al).  Likely entirely new approaches to measuring sustainability at the urban scale will be required.

The seminar is designed as a critical and collective inquiry into current issues of the urban design discipline.  Through a series of lectures, readings, case studies, discussions, presentations, site visits and research work, students focus on the issues that are currently part of the global discourse regarding shaping urban growth and change in the 21st century.  The seminar will be structured around five key issues facing the discipline: 1 Design on a Big Scale Urban Designers are generating visions at the scale of the City and Region.  There is a need to think holistically and effectively bridge disciplines in order to deliver integrated solutions.  Seminar participants will explore how urbanists play a vital role in making a good city: one that is more beautiful, equitable, and sustainable. 2. Sustainable Urbanism Urban Designers are addressing the complex environmental, economic, and social forces that effect City + Regional form.  Seminar participants will explore notable Green Cities Initiatives (Chicago, Freiburg, et al); integrated design strategies for Cities + Regions; change in Sea Level Rise (impact on coastal cities); LEED ND, LAND and other rating systems that address the scale of the site, city and region; smart growth, etc. 3. Density Urban Designers are currently addressing the duality of the global urban condition in the 21st century: both Shrinking Cities and exponential urban grown in the BRIC nations.  Seminar participants will explore Transit Oriented Development (TOD), Value Densification, Dense Housing Typologies, Mixed-Use Development, etc., and identify both the environmental, economic and social benefits and impacts of density. 4. Design Agency Urban Designers, to effect their significant role in urban growth and change, must behave as change agents.  Seminar participants will explore the various avenues for design agency, including: practice, advocacy, elected + appointed positions, community building, community process and civic engagement, environmental justice. 5. Next Generation Urban + Regional Designers are currently debating how to best cultivate the next generation to pursue careers in urban + regional design both in the academy and in practice settings.

Students investigate the role that density plays in sustainable urbanism.  The course focuses on inquiry and experimentation at an urban scale, with collective and individual investigations in spatial analysis, the visualization of digital geography and tools for mapping and modeling the complexity, density and ever changing state of the urban condition.  Students will develop awareness of, and skills in, the use of current 4-dimensional digital design tools and understand the influence of these tools on the future of urban form.  Students will describe density broadly using sets of comparative social, environmental, and economic metrics, and then analyze global urbanized regions representing low, medium and igh density in order to make proposals that balance the long term benefits and impacts of urban density.

The seminar is designed as a critical and collective inquiry into prevalent principles and practices of urban design in order to develop an in-depth, interdisciplinary approach toward a more meaningful urban design for the future.  Through a series of readings, discussions, case studies, presentations, and research work, students focus on deficiencies and opportunities in current urban design approaches, and formulate their own perspectives of urban process implementation and strategies of urban form intervention, based on a critical understanding of the fundamental nature of cities.  Urban design is also practiced in multiple ways.  Utilizing case studies and invited practitioners, this course exposes students to selected design and development processes, such as issues of real estate practice and law, issues of professional accountability and values, public policy, economic feasibility, influences of political and financial institutions, zoning and covenants, infrastructure, traffic engineering, phasing of development, environmental impact analysis, and the regulatory system.

<td class="ntdefault">
Examination of the principles and elements of contemporary
motion graphics for broadcast, web animation, architectural
presentation, environmental art and film titles.  A
principal aim will be to explore strategies and techniques
of graphic storytelling, to develop ideas and structures,
and design the surface of the motion.  A secondary goal is
to investigate the new digital tools to understand the
practice of producing motion design for service-industry
studios.  The computer will be used as the primary design
tool.  Active exploration of the use of different kinds of
digital graphic tools in all phases of the motion graphic
design process will be a focus.

The intent of this course is to foster and expand entrepreneurial concepts by utilizing all of the studentâs educational and professional experience.  The product development cycle focuses on teamwork, effective problem solving, and leadership skills.  First, the class brainstorms several product ideas and a selection process is used to determine which ideas will progress to products.  Then working in student-selected teams, a patent search is done to see if the product idea is novel, and a market study is performed on the selected product idea.  The team will then design, engineer, test, and construct a working product based on their market feedback information.  This product is the corner stone to starting a company that will have a realistic time table and target ROI.  Several oral presentation and work outside of the classroom are required.  Video recording of the final presentation and product demonstration is done and several industrial advisory board members may be present as a panel to assess the student presentation and product.

This course provides students with an opportunity to conceive design and implement a product, using rapid prototyping methods and computer-aided tools.  The first of two phases challenges each student team to meet a set of design requirements and constraints for a structural component.  A course of iteration, fabrication, and validation completes this manual design cycle.  During the second phase, each team conducts design optimization using structural analysis software, with their phase one prototype as a baseline.
