The increased implementation of new media technology has allowed for larger audiences of performances and interactions that were once only in the realm of individual experience, and created new forms which are neither exclusively performance nor documentation.

"The period of the ""long"" French Revolution (1789-1804) as well as the early years of the Third Republic (instituted in 1870) laid the foundations for present-day France. Together, these events turned ""peasants"" into Frenchmen, in the words of one historian. Disparate populations with regional loyalties and identities slowly came to share a national identity, one forged, nurtured and propagated by a number of different institutions, texts, ceremonies, artifacts. We will be considering the construction of a French identity through these media, a French identity that has repeatedly been contested and debated.In order to better understand the formation of French identity since the 18th century, we will explore the material culture of Paris. More specifically, we will study its art, architecture, literature, film, etc. In considering these forms of cultural expression, students will use Paris itself as a historical document or text - one that bears the traces of important social, political, and cultural events. By spending a week in Paris and exploring the city and its monuments from an interdisciplinary perspective, students will confront the following questions: What can the physical landscape of Paris tell us about French history and its evolution? How did the work of French artists and writers reflect (and engender) an emerging sense of national identity? In what ways did the French government use architecture as a means of communicating political ideology and imperial power? How does the past function as a text that is used to construct current cultural and political narratives?",IAHIS3710 Paris at the Crossroads,,,3,College of Art and Design,,IAHIS - Art History,
"This course explores various critical discourses that serve to frame and shape our understanding of art, visual culture, and their respective histories. What is more, its primarily aim is to examine texts about images, than the images themselves. It is designed to provide students with a basic introduction to the theories and methodologies that define the related disciplines of art history, visual studies, and museum studies. At the same time, students will have the opportunity to engage with issues relating to the wider realm of visual culture in contemporary society. This course is interdisciplinary in its scope. Accordingly, all forms of visual expression will be open for critical examination, including painting, sculpture, photography, installation art, performance, animation, digital media, mass communication, etc. The course will also consider the institutions that underpin the contemporary global art world: museums, auction houses, biennials and art fairs, galleries, critics and art press.

While both sexes receive attention, the female nude will be central to the discussion of gender discourse in post-Enlightenment West. The class also analyzes the age-old controversy over the ""nude"" versus the ""naked"" (which leads to the question of art versus pornography) in light of such contemporary debates as the one over Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs. Finally, in addition to the readings and written assignments, the course offers a studio component.

"Democracy means political equality-all members of society have an equal opportunity to participate in the public decisions that affect their lives. In large, complex, economically stratified societies, democracy is an unreachable, but approachable, ideal. Electoral systems are imperfect, but practical, means to approach democratic ends. Elections serve three main political functions: empowerment, representation and legitimation. Elections can allow some members of society to empower and enrich themselves; they may ensure that government is more or less representative of the citizenry; and they can give people the impression that the regime deserves to rule. This course examines how different types of electoral systems serve these functions and achieve more or less democratic outcomes.
