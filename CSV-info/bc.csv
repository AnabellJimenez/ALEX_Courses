Germany's immigration policy and approach to the refugee crisis also stood out from the rest of Europe, as well as the rest of the world. Angela Merkel defended her ""open door"" approach fiercely. However, increasing pressure in Europe and within Germany is stalling and potentially derailing the proposed German immigration policies. Immigration policy is a very complex and multi-faceted topic, which many people fail to understand. It has a humanitarian dimension, but also widespread economic effects. This course will study a subset of these, in the context (but not limited to) economic development and growth.

PHIL,3,4387,"Philosophy is full of wonderfully perplexing arguments aimed at undermining our claims to knowledge.  Like this one: If I know I have two hands, then I know Im not just a brain in a vat.  But, I dont know Im not just a brain in a vat.  So, I dont know I have two hands.  Or this one: A claim is known only if it is justified.  Claims cannot rest on themselves for justification, cannot depend on nothing for justification, and cannot be justified by an infinite series of propositions.  But as those are the only options, we must not know anything.  Or this one: I believe that God exists, but many of my epistemic peers and superiors believe that God does not exist.  Therefore, I have a strong countervailing reason to believe God does not exist such that my belief is not justified.

HIST,3,5225,"Religious difference was fact of high and late medieval life. Christendom was home to Jews, Muslims, heretics, and other dissenters. This colloquium will ponder the history and historiography of religious difference and the conditions that led to moments of toleration, conflict, and repression. Was medieval Europe a persecuting society as many scholars have argued? Or were episodes of religiously motivated violence and repression a product of specific historical conditions that interrupted a state of de facto tolerance for others?","Religious Dissent, Repression and Toleration in the Middle Ages "
