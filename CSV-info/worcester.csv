ECON,110X,"In its simplest form, economics is about how people respond to incentives. Every day, we all make many decisions in which we choose among the options available to us by responding to the relevant incentives. People wake up and decide whether to go to school or work, or enjoy a day of leisure. They choose what to do with the money that they earn. Though people typically do not understand the complex cost/benefit analysis associated with the decisions that they make, they for the most part make decisions suggesting that they do. In this course, we will study the  economics  of  real  world  situations  like  those  from  the books Freakonomics  and Super Freakonomics.

ECON,2125,"Cat. II This course is a general introduction to the field of development economics. The focus is on ways in which a developing country can increase its productive  capacity, both agricultural and industrial, in order to achieve sustained economic  growth. The course proceeds by first examining how economic growth and  economic development are measured and how the various nations of the world  compare according to well-known social and economic indicators. Theories of  economic growth and theories of economic development are then examined, as  are the various social and cultural structures that are thought to influence  economic progress. The inputs to economic growth and development (land,  labor, capital, entrepreneurial ability, education, technical change), and the  possible distributions of income and levels of employment that result from their use, is considered next. Domestic economic problems and policies such as  development planning, the choice of sectorial policies, the choice of monetary  and fiscal policies, rapid population growth, and urbanization and urban  economic development are then examined. The course concludes with a  consideration of international problems and policies such as import substitution  and export promotion, foreign debt, foreign investment, and the role of  international firms. In conjunction with a traditional presentation of the above  topics, the course curriculum will include the use of computer simulation  models and games. These materials have been formulated with a simulation technique, system dynamics, that has its origins in control engineering and the  theory of servomechanisms. As a result, students will find them complementary  to their work in engineering and science. In addition, the various development theories and simulation and gaming results will be related, where possible, to specific developing nations where WPI has on-going project activities (e.g., Costa Rica and Thailand).

ENV,250X,"China has undergone extraordinary social, economic, and pol itical change over the past 30 years.  Since entering the `take-off? phase of economic  growth in the late 1970?s, China has exhibited some of the world?s strongest economic growth  rates.  Part of this trend has been that millions of people have been lifted out of poverty.  The relationship between growth, poverty and development, however, is not simple, and is often mediated by environmental impacts that have been unevenly experienced by different regions, rural/urban populations, and  socioeconomic and demographic groups.   Put differently, Chinese economic development has brought with it environmental problems and policy responses     that are not evenly distributed among citizens.  Through the perspectives of environmental justice, this course looks at the impacts of: economic development in China (pollution, migration, energy requirements and foreign investment); policy responses to environmental problems such as urban planning and  alternative energy solutions; and the growing number of environmental movements in China that are focused on issues such as pollution and human displacement.

ENV,2600," Cat. II Environment and development are often seen as incompatible, in part because many poor people in the developing world depend directly on natural resources  for their livelihoods. At the same time, poor people are often seen as responsible  for causing environmental degradation because they lack the knowledge, skills  and resources to manage the environment effectively. The vicious circle is  completed as environmental degradation exacerbates poverty. However,  optimists argue that poor people can and do contribute positively to environmental o utcomes, that states and organizations can facilitate their efforts and  that environmental interventions can coincide with development.

Social media has also allowed people to share resources (financial, expertise, and organizational) with other social actors across the globe, empowering communities in novel ways. This course introduces students to the phenomena of social and environmental movements, theories on why they succeed and fail, and how social media has changed the landscape of social mobilization. This course will draw on interdisciplinary readings, concepts, and case studies from the social sciences, with emphasis on geography, public policy, sociology, and media studies. Course work will include small group projects, analyses of current social movement cases, and a final project. The final project will consist of interviewing members of a current social movement (potentially using social media), evaluating whether particular social media applications have helped to enable social mobilization, and designing new or revised social media tools to further enhance social mobilization.      Recommended background: introductory environmental studies (ENV1100 or equivalent). ","SOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL MOVEMENTS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT"

Worst-case scenarios envision irrevocable degradation of the earth?s natural systems, but virtually every analysis sees the  need for major change worldwide to cope with problems such as global  warming, deforestation, ozone layer depletion, loss of biodiversity, and  population growth, not to mention exponential increases in ""conventional""  pollutants in newly industrialized countries. The global environment issues  represent a ""second-generation"" of environmental policy in which the focus of  concern has moved from national regulations to international law and institutions. In addition, the environment has emerged as a major aspect of  international trade, conditioning corporate investment and accounting for some  $200 billion in sales of pollution control equipment in 1991. Exploration of the  genesis and implications of these phenomena is the essence of the course.  Topically, the material begins with the nature of global environmental problems,  drawing on literature from large-scale global modeling as well as particular  analyses of the problems mentioned above. Approximately half the course  focuses on international laws and institutions, including multilateral treaties  (e.g., the Montreal Protocol limiting CFC use, ocean dumping, biodiversity),  international institutions (UNEP, the Rio Convention, the OECD) and private  initiatives (international standards organizations, ICOLP (Industry Committee for Ozone Layer Protection), etc.) In addition, US policy toward global  environmental issues will be compared with that in Japan, Europe and  developing countries, from which it differs significantly.

The curriculum in this  course is divided into three distinct parts. First, a detailed examination of the  steps of the system dynamics modeling process: problem identification  (including data collection), feedback structure conceptualization, model  formulation, model testing and analysis, model documentation and presentation,  and policy implementation. Second, a survey of the ""nuts and bolts"" of continuous simulation modeling: information and material delays, time constants, the use of noise and numerical integration techniques, control theory  heuristics, and software details (both simulation and model presentation and  documentation software). Third, a step-by-step, in-class production of a model,  involving the construction, testing, and assembly of subsectors. Students will be  required to complete modeling assignments working in groups and take in-class  quizzes on modeling issues.  Recommended background: SD 1510, or permission of instructor.",SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODELING
SOC,221X,"In this course psychological concepts developed to study personality and creativity connect with concepts from the sociology of education and the study of innovation.  The result is a psycho-sociological perspective on ?learning styles? as they affect both individual and active cooperative learning in small groups.  Several different measures of learning style will be discussed in this course, including the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the Gordon-Mednick Cognitive Style Indicator, and others. Applications of these measures to a variety of outcomes will be examined, including SAT scores, high school achievement tests, career and major choices, student reactions to courses, texts, and programs, 4-year graduation rates, graduation with honors, and team formation in college and the workplace. The course culminates in a final team project that will take the form of a proposal writing exercise to recommend changes to a public school system or college on how to best serve different kinds of learners. Suggested background: PSY1402 or STS1207. ","LEARNING STYLES, CREATIVITY, AND TEAMWORK"
SOC,1202,"This course encourages students to explore how a sociological toolkit may be used to examine the impetus for social and historical changes and the effect such changes have on how individuals live, work, and find their place in this world. It operates from the premise that individual lives are not just personal but social?as humans we are shaped by the societies in which we live and the social forces at work within them. Major theoretical perspectives and concepts will be discussed over the course of the semester with primary emphasis on the roles that culture, dimensions of inequality and social change play in shaping individual lives.  Students will also explore the influence that social institutions such as the family, religion, education, healthcare, government, economy, and environment have on how humans function within society.",INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY
SS,150X,"This course addresses the theory and practice of developing solutions to complex social and environmental problems through interaction with roleplaying games and computer simulations designed to promote learning and improve decision-making. By interacting with a selection of games and case studies, students will learn to recognize the systemic causes of complex social and environmental problems and gain experience developing and using simulations to test policies for creating sustainable futures. Special attention will be given to appropriate modeling practices and the design of simulation experiments. The course is run in a laboratory format in which students work in groups to play games, develop simulation models and present them to the class for feedback before they revise and refine their work iteratively for final evaluation.      Recommended background: None      Students may not receive credit for both SS 150X and SD 150X..  ",GAMES OF UNDERSTANDING COMPLEXITY
SS,2400,"What is the process by which a hypothesis about human behavior gets supported or rejected? This course represents a review of the methodological tools of social  and behavioral science. Topics to be covered include experimental design and  ethical issues specific to behavioral research with human subjects, the use of  statistical and simulation modeling in the interpretation of behavioral  phenomena, and methods for statistical inference in compiling evidence for or against a hypothesis.        Recommended background: PSY 1400 and either PSY 1401 or PSY 1402. ","METHODS, MODELING, AND ANALYSIS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE"
STS,120X,"The focus of global health research and practice is improving the overall health and health equity of all people worldwide.  In this course, we will use an interdisciplinary approach to explore the major underlying biological determinants of health including the contributions of social, political, environmental, and economic factors. We will analyze the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable disease facing the world?s populations including study of current health systems, global health practices and priorities as well as major organization and institutional players. Class sessions will consist of lecture, intensive small group discussion, and global health case analyses.       After successful completion of this course, students will be able to  explain the basic principles of public health; discuss the determinants of health; describe how globalization has changed the patterns of the spread of disease and the methods needed to control disease; evaluate the complex, multi-faceted links between health, social and economic factors; and identify critical issues in the delivery of health care services, with a particular emphasis on challenges faced with regard to different cultural and economic settings.

STS,1207,"This course will describe how traditional issues addressed in the Sociology of Science dealing with science as an institution, social controversies involving  science, priority disputes within science and process of scientific discovery are  illuminated by studies using measures borrowed from psychology. Examples will  involve measures of cognitive style, personality and openness to innovation. The  scientific pipeline that runs through the science programs in the educational  system and the experience of women as students and as practicing scientists will  be addressed as a science and society equity issue. Problems balancing the roles  of the scientist as expert and concerned citizen in a democratic but technological  society will also be addressed.       This course works equally well as a second course  after PSY 1402, Social Psychology, or a first course in Social Science. ",INTRODUCTION TO THE PSYCHO-SOCIOLOGY OF SCIENCE
STS,2208,"A course which considers what one means when they say that we live in a technological society, focusing on the characteristics of technology that  humanistic critics find problematic or objectionable. In the course of the  analysis, the nature of technology, its connection to scientific advance, as well as  its relationship to the state, and the social role of scientists and technologists will  be considered. Special attention is given to the behavior of experts in scientific and technological controversies, and to the debate about the ?technological  mentality? said to pervade western societies. Utopian, Dystopian and Marxist  interpretations of where technological development is taking us will be  examined in an effort to understand the major themes in the larger debate about the social impact of technology. Computer science majors can take this course in  place of CS 3043 if they write a term paper on a computer-related topic.        Recommended background: SOC 1202.  ",THE SOCIETY-TECHNOLOGY DEBATE
