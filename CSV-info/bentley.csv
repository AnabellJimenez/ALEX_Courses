 Mathematical Logic,"MA305 Mathematical Logic Prerequisite(s): Completion of any freshman mathematics sequenceNote: This course is also listed as PH 305; it can be used as either a philosophy or mathematical sciences elective depending on which designator the student chooses at registration.Mathematics analyzes the world in a precise, quantitative way.  Mathematical logic applies that same precise analysis to mathematics itself.  Analysis of mathematical formulas, how they are constructed and how they relate, lead to the two most famous formal reasoning systems, classical propositional logic and classical predicate logic.  Arguments constructed through formal reasoning in these systems are compared to informal reasoning. Examples of logic in algebra and the foundations of calculus lead to consideration of historically important questions such as, ""Do we know that the generally accepted rules for reasoning are correct, or reliable?""  This leads to the study of historical roots of non-classical logics and their relationship to computer science. ",MA,MA305
