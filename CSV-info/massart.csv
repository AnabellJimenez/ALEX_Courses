They typically expect to enter major concentrations that rely more heavily on drawing, such as illustration, fashion, industrial design, animation, graphic design, printmaking and painting.Acknowledging different abilities within this class, a variety of challenge levels are designed for projects throughout the semester.Thematic Menu courses advance the formal and expressive issues introduced first semester but with a specific focus area. Intensely exploring a single theme, participants take the time needed to develop a drawing practice, conceptually and technically.

From the Diego Rivera murals and Fridas home to the great pyramids at Teotihuacan and one of the most splendid anthropological museums in the world, Mexico City is unparalleled as a magnet for artists across media. Puebla and Cholula have inspired artists from pre-Colonial times. We travel to south central Mexico and visit remarkable sites, including colonial palaces and homes, cathedrals and basilicas, museums and art galleries, local artists and ateliers and amazing markets. Talavera covered architecture native to Puebla and covered with polychrome patterns, introduces the second part of our journey. Puebla and the historic Hotel Colonial will be our hub after 4 days in Mexico City. Pre-Hispanic tombs and pyramids with intricate stone carved drawings, dozens of religious cathedrals and basilicas built by the Spaniards with unique paintings and patterned adornments, artisan markets with indigenous groups identified by traditionally patterned garments all provide a lush environment for art students and an opportunity for immersion in a culture very different from our own and our very close neighbor.
