Course Attributes: Arch - Graduate",History of Urban Form
ARC,    3,5693,"Urbanized areas around the globe are increasingly becoming the focus of debate around sustainability.  The majority of the world's population now resides in Cities and their urbanized regions.  This figure is projected to be 75% by 2030.  This course will address how urban designers can and should go beyond the building to embrace a more balanced and holistic systems approach to design and policy initiatives for these critical centers of civilization.  This is to integrate them into and go beyond physical or environmental aspects of current notions of sustainable design, beyond the current popularity of narrowly focused rating systems (such as LEED ND) and single issues (such as energy). Building on the introduction to Sustainable Urbanism in the MUD Current Issues seminar, this course will address the complex environmental, economic, social, cultural, political, and ethical forces that affect City + Regional form.  The seminar will explore notable national and international precedents of integrated design strategies for Cities + Regions (Chicago, Portland, Freiburg, Curitiba, Barcelona, Emscher Park, et al).  Within this globalized context and broadened framework of sustainability, we will ask the students to define the meaning of sustainability in the context of cities and urban development.  Themes addressed will include: Citizenship: how will the need for sustainable urbanism create a new citizen for the 21st century?  What are the values/value systems that will drive the creation of sustainable place?  What will be the evolving role of the citizen from awareness and lifestyle changes to active role as designer and stewards of their environment Equity: addressing the imbalance between resource rich urbanized areas in low growth mode and those that are in high growth mode where resource scarcity exists.  How will equity play a role in providing for under-capitalized/served communities in determining resources allocation and accessibility?  Economics: focusing on strategic investments where and when do we invest within the city and region?  What will be the evolving role of the public and private sectors and partnerships?  Urban density is already an emerging result of such debates.  What sort of urban form will such policy and investment decisions drive?  Infrastructure: establishing a broadened notion of infrastructure the new ecosystem of the city including blue, green, and gray defined by water and marine resources, all aspects of the natural environment and built public realm, and the man-made technologies and infrastructure that will create future utilities and movement systems that will support mobility and accessibility.  How can we balance population growth and needs with the very real necessity of protecting increasingly fragile natural systems of the planet?  Measuring Sustainable Urbanism current metrics such as LEED are not suited to the scale of the city and region.  There is an emergent field investigation how can such rating systems be expanded and adapted (e.g. LAND, BREEAM, et al).  Likely entirely new approaches to measuring sustainability at the urban scale will be required.

Through a series of lectures, readings, case studies, discussions, presentations, site visits and research work, students focus on the issues that are currently part of the global discourse regarding shaping urban growth and change in the 21st century.  The seminar will be structured around five key issues facing the discipline: 1 Design on a Big Scale Urban Designers are generating visions at the scale of the City and Region.  There is a need to think holistically and effectively bridge disciplines in order to deliver integrated solutions.  Seminar participants will explore how urbanists play a vital role in making a good city: one that is more beautiful, equitable, and sustainable. 2. Sustainable Urbanism Urban Designers are addressing the complex environmental, economic, and social forces that effect City + Regional form.  Seminar participants will explore notable Green Cities Initiatives (Chicago, Freiburg, et al); integrated design strategies for Cities + Regions; change in Sea Level Rise (impact on coastal cities); LEED ND, LAND and other rating systems that address the scale of the site, city and region; smart growth, etc. 3. Density Urban Designers are currently addressing the duality of the global urban condition in the 21st century: both Shrinking Cities and exponential urban grown in the BRIC nations.  Seminar participants will explore Transit Oriented Development (TOD), Value Densification, Dense Housing Typologies, Mixed-Use Development, etc., and identify both the environmental, economic and social benefits and impacts of density. 4. Design Agency Urban Designers, to effect their significant role in urban growth and change, must behave as change agents.  Seminar participants will explore the various avenues for design agency, including: practice, advocacy, elected + appointed positions, community building, community process and civic engagement, environmental justice. 5. Next Generation Urban + Regional Designers are currently debating how to best cultivate the next generation to pursue careers in urban + regional design both in the academy and in practice settings.

Then working in student-selected teams, a patent search is done to see if the product idea is novel, and a market study is performed on the selected product idea.  The team will then design, engineer, test, and construct a working product based on their market feedback information.  This product is the corner stone to starting a company that will have a realistic time table and target ROI.  Several oral presentation and work outside of the classroom are required.  Video recording of the final presentation and product demonstration is done and several industrial advisory board members may be present as a panel to assess the student presentation and product.

Course Attributes: Arch - Graduate",History of Urban Form
ARC,    3,5693,"Urbanized areas around the globe are increasingly becoming the focus of debate around sustainability.  The majority of the world's population now resides in Cities and their urbanized regions.  This figure is projected to be 75% by 2030.  This course will address how urban designers can and should go beyond the building to embrace a more balanced and holistic systems approach to design and policy initiatives for these critical centers of civilization.  This is to integrate them into and go beyond physical or environmental aspects of current notions of sustainable design, beyond the current popularity of narrowly focused rating systems (such as LEED ND) and single issues (such as energy). Building on the introduction to Sustainable Urbanism in the MUD Current Issues seminar, this course will address the complex environmental, economic, social, cultural, political, and ethical forces that affect City + Regional form.  The seminar will explore notable national and international precedents of integrated design strategies for Cities + Regions (Chicago, Portland, Freiburg, Curitiba, Barcelona, Emscher Park, et al).  Within this globalized context and broadened framework of sustainability, we will ask the students to define the meaning of sustainability in the context of cities and urban development.  Themes addressed will include: Citizenship: how will the need for sustainable urbanism create a new citizen for the 21st century?  What are the values/value systems that will drive the creation of sustainable place?  What will be the evolving role of the citizen from awareness and lifestyle changes to active role as designer and stewards of their environment Equity: addressing the imbalance between resource rich urbanized areas in low growth mode and those that are in high growth mode where resource scarcity exists.  How will equity play a role in providing for under-capitalized/served communities in determining resources allocation and accessibility?  Economics: focusing on strategic investments where and when do we invest within the city and region?  What will be the evolving role of the public and private sectors and partnerships?  Urban density is already an emerging result of such debates.  What sort of urban form will such policy and investment decisions drive?  Infrastructure: establishing a broadened notion of infrastructure the new ecosystem of the city including blue, green, and gray defined by water and marine resources, all aspects of the natural environment and built public realm, and the man-made technologies and infrastructure that will create future utilities and movement systems that will support mobility and accessibility.  How can we balance population growth and needs with the very real necessity of protecting increasingly fragile natural systems of the planet?  Measuring Sustainable Urbanism current metrics such as LEED are not suited to the scale of the city and region.  There is an emergent field investigation how can such rating systems be expanded and adapted (e.g. LAND, BREEAM, et al).  Likely entirely new approaches to measuring sustainability at the urban scale will be required.

Through a series of lectures, readings, case studies, discussions, presentations, site visits and research work, students focus on the issues that are currently part of the global discourse regarding shaping urban growth and change in the 21st century.  The seminar will be structured around five key issues facing the discipline: 1 Design on a Big Scale Urban Designers are generating visions at the scale of the City and Region.  There is a need to think holistically and effectively bridge disciplines in order to deliver integrated solutions.  Seminar participants will explore how urbanists play a vital role in making a good city: one that is more beautiful, equitable, and sustainable. 2. Sustainable Urbanism Urban Designers are addressing the complex environmental, economic, and social forces that effect City + Regional form.  Seminar participants will explore notable Green Cities Initiatives (Chicago, Freiburg, et al); integrated design strategies for Cities + Regions; change in Sea Level Rise (impact on coastal cities); LEED ND, LAND and other rating systems that address the scale of the site, city and region; smart growth, etc. 3. Density Urban Designers are currently addressing the duality of the global urban condition in the 21st century: both Shrinking Cities and exponential urban grown in the BRIC nations.  Seminar participants will explore Transit Oriented Development (TOD), Value Densification, Dense Housing Typologies, Mixed-Use Development, etc., and identify both the environmental, economic and social benefits and impacts of density. 4. Design Agency Urban Designers, to effect their significant role in urban growth and change, must behave as change agents.  Seminar participants will explore the various avenues for design agency, including: practice, advocacy, elected + appointed positions, community building, community process and civic engagement, environmental justice. 5. Next Generation Urban + Regional Designers are currently debating how to best cultivate the next generation to pursue careers in urban + regional design both in the academy and in practice settings.

The seminar will explore notable national and international precedents of integrated design strategies for Cities + Regions (Chicago, Portland, Freiburg, Curitiba, Barcelona, Emscher Park, et al).  Within this globalized context and broadened framework of sustainability, we will ask the students to define the meaning of sustainability in the context of cities and urban development.  Themes addressed will include: Citizenship: how will the need for sustainable urbanism create a new citizen for the 21st century?  What are the values/value systems that will drive the creation of sustainable place?  What will be the evolving role of the citizen from awareness and lifestyle changes to active role as designer and stewards of their environment Equity: addressing the imbalance between resource rich urbanized areas in low growth mode and those that are in high growth mode where resource scarcity exists.  How will equity play a role in providing for under-capitalized/served communities in determining resources allocation and accessibility?  Economics: focusing on strategic investments where and when do we invest within the city and region?  What will be the evolving role of the public and private sectors and partnerships?  Urban density is already an emerging result of such debates.  What sort of urban form will such policy and investment decisions drive?  Infrastructure: establishing a broadened notion of infrastructure the new ecosystem of the city including blue, green, and gray defined by water and marine resources, all aspects of the natural environment and built public realm, and the man-made technologies and infrastructure that will create future utilities and movement systems that will support mobility and accessibility.  How can we balance population growth and needs with the very real necessity of protecting increasingly fragile natural systems of the planet?  Measuring Sustainable Urbanism current metrics such as LEED are not suited to the scale of the city and region.  There is an emergent field investigation how can such rating systems be expanded and adapted (e.g. LAND, BREEAM, et al).  Likely entirely new approaches to measuring sustainability at the urban scale will be required.

Through a series of lectures, readings, case studies, discussions, presentations, site visits and research work, students focus on the issues that are currently part of the global discourse regarding shaping urban growth and change in the 21st century.  The seminar will be structured around five key issues facing the discipline: 1 Design on a Big Scale Urban Designers are generating visions at the scale of the City and Region.  There is a need to think holistically and effectively bridge disciplines in order to deliver integrated solutions.  Seminar participants will explore how urbanists play a vital role in making a good city: one that is more beautiful, equitable, and sustainable. 2. Sustainable Urbanism Urban Designers are addressing the complex environmental, economic, and social forces that effect City + Regional form.  Seminar participants will explore notable Green Cities Initiatives (Chicago, Freiburg, et al); integrated design strategies for Cities + Regions; change in Sea Level Rise (impact on coastal cities); LEED ND, LAND and other rating systems that address the scale of the site, city and region; smart growth, etc. 3. Density Urban Designers are currently addressing the duality of the global urban condition in the 21st century: both Shrinking Cities and exponential urban grown in the BRIC nations.  Seminar participants will explore Transit Oriented Development (TOD), Value Densification, Dense Housing Typologies, Mixed-Use Development, etc., and identify both the environmental, economic and social benefits and impacts of density. 4. Design Agency Urban Designers, to effect their significant role in urban growth and change, must behave as change agents.  Seminar participants will explore the various avenues for design agency, including: practice, advocacy, elected + appointed positions, community building, community process and civic engagement, environmental justice. 5. Next Generation Urban + Regional Designers are currently debating how to best cultivate the next generation to pursue careers in urban + regional design both in the academy and in practice settings.
