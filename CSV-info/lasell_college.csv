Communication,"This course will explore this significant question: Should we take TV seriously as a form of mass communication? The answer can be found in the ways that TV produces meanings for the audience and our culture as a dominant form of entertainment over that past 60 plus years in post WWII America. As such, TV demands our scrutiny. Throughout the course, we will look at such topics as how TV entertainment narrative is structured, how sets are designed, how sound interacts with image, how commercials persuade and how these structures can emphasize certain meanings (and de-emphasize others) and transmit values to viewers. Current trends in technological shifts have forced changes in the delivery of TV programming, for example to audio and video files streaming on computers, such as tablets, the decline of network TV and the rise of hundreds of cable channels. However, all of these new technologies demand more TV entertainment content, not less.This course uses two avenues of inquiry: one exploring the mass communication basis for studying the content delivered through medium of TV; and another outlining an analysis of TV content which illustrates the transmission of cultural values (primarily American) to the audience.

An intensive experience elsewhere is often overwhelming because of the depth of new perspective it calls for and the many challenges it poses to the ways of living and thinking we once considered normal.Our sense of self, our family and friends, our goals, and even our understanding of the world may be in the process of a fundamental shift.This course creates the opportunity for us to exchange our varied international and regional experiences and to guide each other through those changes together.Readings, essays, documentaries, and dialogues will help us reframe our experiences in both a global and a local context. We want to reintegrate our experiential discovery into a larger framework for understanding why things work the way they do and how they are interconnected.We will examine various cultures and their values, international relations, the world's political economy, the global environment, etc.Each student will conduct further fact-based research on those regions to which they have traveled or plan to travel to and investigate the questions that this comparative framework opens about their experiences elsewhere.","IDS220X - I'm Back, Now What?
