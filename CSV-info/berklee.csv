",Jazz Fusion Composition and Arranging for Small Ensemble,"Through the study of major artists and recordings, the student will identify the compositional and instrumental practices of the jazz fusion idiom and apply those to writing assignments and projects. Jazz fusion is looked at broadly and may include a variety of idiomatic 20th-century world music and popular music techniques. The course does not follow a particular methodology, but rather encourages the student to find his/her own voice within the genre. The class begins with a historical survey of the jazz fusion idiom starting with Miles Davis's landmark Bitches Brew recording and continues with the music of the alumni of Davis' influential bands, up to today. As students apply techniques and ideas learned, they will gain perspective as to how jazz fusion is part of music as a whole and examine some of the underlying principles that make for good composition. A special section of the course will be dedicated to introducing students to some fundamentals of Indian ragas (scales) and to Konnikol (Indian rhythmic solfege) and their application to contemporary jazz-fusion composition. Groups such as Shakti, Miles From India, Trilok Gurtu, The Marc Rossi Group, and others have brought this information to the forefront, and it is helping to redefine jazz fusion.",2 credit(s),CM-345

Furthermore, the cognitive process involved in the construction of a resultant metrical perspective will be discussed. Sight-reading and general rhythmic comprehension are challenged through a series of exercises and drills featuring odd-time patterns and polyrhythmic independence between the voice and the body, as well as advanced studies of mixed subdivisions. The intent is to strengthen internal coordination of multiple rhythmic voices, as well as sharpen one's precision and clarity when performing.",2 credit(s),ET-341

How can you access these new sounds and make them part of your own language? In this course, ear training drills and compositional exercises work hand in hand. Students practice identifying and singing/playing quarter-tones, sixth-tones, and even twelfth-tones (time permitting), exploring new modes of expression as they begin to hear in a different way. Along the way, we listen to a variety of examples of microtonal music from different styles an traditions, examining and transcribing small excerpts, and we conclude the semester with a final composition/performance project involving group collaboration amongst classmates.",2 credit(s),ET-P399

",Race and the Visual Arts,"In this course, students explore the representation of race in visual culture and the ways in which culture marks subjects, objects, and bodies with racial identity. Wherever we look we are confronted by images that are explicitly or implicitly racializedin artistic production, marketing and advertising, film and television, magazines and newspapers, and science and technology. In American society our history confronts us with the painful reminders of the oppression and marginalization of bodies whose color deviates from whiteness. Students explore the ways that visual artists have problematized the representation of racial identity. Students also explore how one talks back to images about racialized bodies. How do marketing and advertising exploit and/or privilege certain types of racialized bodies in the visual field? How have representations of racial identity evolved over the course of the history of film and television? When is racial identity foregrounded? When it is veiled and why? How do medicine and technology reconfigure how we see racialized bodies? How do other categories of differences such as gender, sexuality, and class complicate the representation of racialized bodies? In this course, students read texts from history, literature, sociology, Africana studies, visual studies, art history, and cultural studies; they view images of painting, photography, sculpture, performance art, film, television, advertising, and medical research. If you want to think critically about racialized imagesfrom Uncle Tom to Aunt Jemima and beyondthen this is the class for you!",3 credit(s),LAHS-P236

","Artist, Society, and the Avant-Garde","This course explores the changing and multiple roles of art and the artist in society as these have evolved from classical antiquity to the contemporary period. We begin by exploring how the Greek and Medieval ideas of the artist as imitator and craftsman were questioned and altered during the Renaissance and later periods, when the Modern idea of the artist as individual creator, and avant-garde figure, began to take hold in Western artistic, philosophical, and political culture. The course places special emphasis on the role of the artist today, by locating a key moment of change in the late eighteenth century, when the French and American revolutions altered the political landscape of the West in fundamental ways by questioning the authority of the church and the monarchical state, and by establishing democratic institutions that, in theory at least, stressed the equality of all individuals. It is out of this crux of political and social change that the avant-gardeand our modern notion of the artist as a kind of free agent, pursuing his/her own creative, social, and political impulseswas born. The texts we will read, and the examples of visual art and music we will explore, span the period from Greek antiquity to contemporary times, and include works by Plato, Aristotle, Leonardo da Vinci, Descartes, Kant, Hegel, Gustave Courbet, Marcel Duchamp, John Cage, Cindy Sherman, and others.",3 credit(s),LAHS-P334

For many of todays musicians, being a record producer means making music largely themselves: creating, orchestrating, performing, recording, and/or mixing projects of their own or for another artist. But the traditional role of producer is a collaborator who supports the work of writers, performers, and engineers without necessarily doing any of those jobs. The success of a complex project with numerous participants requires a skill set largely unknown to those whose production experience has been solitary: project coordination, time management, coaching, motivating, and effective interpersonal communication. This course focuses on how musicians can leverage their musical expertise as the basis for taking on broader production responsibilities, specifically when making independent records. Students will gain relevant experience by producing an original song with an artist of their choice.",Principles of Independent Record Production,"For many of todays musicians, being a record producer means making music largely themselves: creating, orchestrating, performing, recording, and/or mixing projects of their own or for another artist.

",Essential Research Methods,"Carl Sagan wrote: Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. This course on research opens a road to discovery. This course is designed to help students grow their scientific thinking and writing skills towards becoming a researcher. This course enables students to develop expertise that supports original, scholarly inquiry. Additionally, scientifically sound research is an integral part of good professional practice. Research and practice go hand in hand as evidence-based practice relies on what is discovered through research. With adept knowledge of varied methods and approaches, students support and justify their research by gathering, storing, organizing, evaluating, generating, and disseminating research literature. They develop new strategies for unearthing literature, from traditional library searches to online explorations, consistently using technologies that facilitate the acquisition and expression of new knowledge. They learn to connect research and practice within the field of music therapy. Students scrutinize a myriad of studies, survey the research history and evaluate current investigations. With careful review and analysis, they develop competency, sharpen their critical thinking skills, and deepen their grasp of clinical applications of music therapy research. They advance the field by designing ethically and scientifically sound inquiries. By the end of this course, students will have written a research proposal for a new study. This proposal could serve as an initial outline for the culminating experience project, which will be further developed in MTH-690, and completed in MTH-695. Those opting for the research track will continue their research through MTH-550 and MTH-551.",3 credit(s),MTH-510

",Music Application and Theory,"This course is a study of popular music. This study begins with the aural analysis of contemporary songs, including bass motion, chord function, and aspects of the rhythm section. It leads to understanding the bass line, harmony, and rhythmic structure of these songs and creation of original pieces in major key and Aeolian mode (natural minor). Keyboard exercises, written homework assignments, and laptop computer drills provide extensive practice in musical and notational elements. Students learn to read and write major and natural minor scales in all keys and learn triads and seventh chords diatonic to those scales. The course provides exposure to chromatic variations on major key harmony: the principles of secondary dominants and modal interchange are studied in limited situations to add color and variety to diatonic harmony. These activities will decode the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic language of most of contemporary popular music and set the stage for a detailed study of more complex and chromatic music in Harmony 2, 3, and 4.",4 credit(s),PW-111
