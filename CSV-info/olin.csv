 History of Technology: A Cultural & Contextual Approach ,"Throughout this semester we will use different history of technology narratives to explore larger themes.  Our narrative case studies will range from bronze age societal studies to cutting edge computing and Internet technologies, and throughout the semester we will compare and contrast these narratives in search of larger trends.  We will also identify and investigate broader issues such as large technological systems; paradigms and scientific revolutions; technologies and political values; ethical theories; and the environmental and sustainability implications of technologies.  Throughout the semester we will engage these narratives and broader issues through targeted writing activities, debates, individual and group presentations, at least one field trip, movie and media studies, and numerous in-class discussions.  Students will have a high degree of autonomy, and will set and evaluate their own learning objectives, determine the topic for final projects, and design and facilitate in-class activities throughout the semester.",AHSE,"

 Special Topics in Science  ,"This course will include equal numbers of Olin and Wellesley students, and will alternate class sessions at both campuses. Students will begin the semester with a series of readings and exercises that build skills and familiarity in the broad area of environmental studies: for example, we will work with framing environmental concept maps using environmental engineering principles (e.g. control volumes, flux, residence time) and environmental science concepts (energy conservation and energy density calculations), historical research and analysis, environmental ethics, and writing/presentation exercises centered around important case studies of interactions between societies, energy technologies, and the natural environment. We will use these skills and perspectives for the remainder of the semester as we conduct two research projects related to energy use, sustainability, and environmental impacts in both ancient societies and the modern day. This course involves extensive team project work and will offer many opportunities for students to identify their own goals and shape their studies in order to achieve those goals.",SCI2,"

 High Energy Astrophysics  ,"The universe is full of hot stuff! The oldest radiation that we can measure originally arose where the temperature was only thousands of degrees, but there is indirect evidence for the early universe that requires temperatures of trillions of degrees. As the universe expands and cools there are still occasional (but quite frequent) episodes involving temperatures of millions or even billions of degrees that are manifested in phenomena like supernovae and black holes. These high energy episodes are not just curiosities: supernovae are responsible for most of the chemical elements associated with life on Earth, and giant black holes are present at the cores of virtually all galaxies. This course will examine how the theoretical and empirical study of X-rays and gamma-rays can probe the high energy universe.",SCI2,"

" Seeing and Hearing: Communicating with Photographs, Video and Sound","Seeing and Hearing is a foundation course that is about the communication of ideas developed by research, reflection, and evolving thought, using contemporary digital media tools as a vehicle for expression. In this project-based course, students will have opportunities for hands-on learning in audio recording and editing, photography and printing, and video recording and editing. Science and engineering content are integrated in order to provide a reasonably comprehensive understanding of the devices we use to gather sound and images and in order to understand more fully the properties of seeing and hearing. A major goal is to enlarge our awareness of the environment we inhabit and to respond to the perceived environment by producing original visual and sonic artwork. Students will complete projects including a self-portrait, a sound-piece that is used as an audio track for a short video, a video documentary, and a staged narrative. Our process is to share work through discussion sessions as we follow projects from their initial stages to completion and final presentation. Additional context for Seeing and Hearing is provided by selected readings, visits by guest lecturers, additional faculty and staff participation and by viewing work of other professional practitioners. This course does not require prior experience with image/sound gathering or editing.",AHSE,"

" The Digital Eye: Photography, Vision, and Visual Communication ","We live in a world that is fundamentally visual and yet formal teaching and learning about visual communication is almost entirely reserved for specialists. Similarly learning about the evolution of vision and the molecular foundations of human vision are not often dealt with in introductory biology courses. This course seeks to remedy the lack of engagement with these topics at the foundational course level. In this studio-based project-oriented course students will develop an understanding of what it takes to make original art through first-hand experiences in a supportive environment. As a means to this end, students will gain facility with digital single- lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, digital photo editing and printing methods using state-of-the-art equipment.  As this is an AHS foundation course students will also have an opportunity to further develop writing communication skills and critical thinking ability.

Author Dev Patnaik explains his interest in this experiment. It comes down to empathy: All of this is to reclaim a very old idea, that quantitative data and facts are no substitute for real-world experience and human connection. Anthropologists have long-argued for the importance of putting oneself in other people shoes for better understanding.

Receptor-ligand binding will be considered and compared to experimental data to discuss mechanisms in cell signaling studies. Basic binding models will be expanded to consider the effect of forces in situations such as white blood cells rolling, detaching, and adhering during surveillance of blood vessels. We will consider the effects of forces from the molecular to the whole cell level. How do cells exert force? And how can we measure those forces? How do the properties of the substrates cells attach to affect their behaviors?  How can we translate observations made in the 2D environment to the 3D environment? And how are these similar and different? These concepts will be explored to study the effect of forces in cellular processes such as migration, traction generation, differentiation, signaling and gene expression.",ENGR,"

 Transport in Biological Systems  ,"Transport phenomena play a vital role in numerous biological processes. For example, the blood flow patterns arising from the particular geometry of branching blood vessels are thought to drive the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Mass transport plays a role in events such as tissue differentiation during development, oxygenation of blood in the lungs, and glomerular filtration in the kidneys. The entire field of drug delivery has been driven and advanced by understanding transport of pharmacological agents within biomaterials and tissues. Further, combination of fluid and mass transport allow us to understand flow through porous media which is critical for understanding problems such as delivery of chemotherapeutics and tumor metastasis. The roles of transport in understanding and treating cancer will be a theme throughout this course. We will study and analyze mathematical models of these key biological problems using both analytical and computational tools. Through a series of readings and projects, this course will combine engineering fundamentals of mass, energy, and momentum conservation with modeling approaches to enhance exploration and understanding of fluid and mass transport within the body. This course will be of value to students interested in biology, mathematical modeling, and bioengineering.",ENGR,"

 Tissue Engineering  ,"Tissue engineering is often defined as growing or regenerating tissues. To grow engineered tissues requires an understanding of the cell and tissue biology as well as understanding of how culture conditions (transport of oxygen and biochemical factors, application of mechanical forces, etc.) affect the growing tissues. This course will begin with an overview of developmental biology and the types of biochemical and biophysical cues cells receive and respond to during development that direct them to form specific tissues, followed by an overview of the larger field of tissue engineering. We will discuss cell source, the use of natural or synthetic biomaterials, development of bioreactors, the use of biochemical supplements, as well as motivations and applications of engineered tissues from replacement of damaged tissues to models of tissue function. The bulk of this course will be dedicated to the design, implementation, and analysis of experiments to grow engineered tissues. This will be an intensive lab-based course in which groups of students will choose the particular aspect of tissue engineering (e.g. scaffold choice, biochemical culture conditions, mechanical stimulation, functional readouts) they would like to pursue and perform their own experiments and analysis (e.g. biochemical, mechanical, histological).

 Identity from the Mind & the Brain: Who Am I and How Do I Know,"Perhaps the most fundamental question any developing individual asks himself/herself is: who am I? The ways we answer this question have evolved over the course of history as the dominant ways of knowing (epistemologies) have shifted. Indeed, the question of how we come to know ourselves has captivated Western scholars since the days of Descartes, but a look at the last fifty to sixty years has also seen enormous changes. Many people invoke psychological and philosophical perspectives in describing their identity, focusing on their personality, their developmental history, and their place in society. But the explosion of neurobiological research has introduced a new and viable outlook: explaining identity at the chemical and electrical level of the brain. There is good reason to think that these different perspectives on identity are mutually exclusive and this tension will underlie everything we discuss in this interdisciplinary course. Indeed, when it comes to a topic as fundamental to human existence as identity, it is absolutely essential to wonder not only ""who am I?"" but to also ask ""how do I know?"" In this course, we will approach the question of identity from multiple perspectives, including psychology, postmodern philosophy, and neuroscience. In the process, we will critically examine not only the conception of identity that each perspective supports, but also the assumptions and limitations of each epistemology. This course focuses more on the science of psychology and neuroscience, while AHSE 1150: What Is ""I""? is more focused on philosophy and artificial intelligence.",AHSE,"

 Human Molecular Genetics in the Age of Genomics ,"It is now understood that many, if not the majority, of human disorders, including cancers, have an underlying genetic component. In this modern age of healthcare, we are expected to choose amongst an array of therapeutic options for ourselves and for our children rather than respond to specific directives from the medical establishment. In addition, we are called upon as voting citizens to make ethical decisions, e.g. the appropriateness of stem cell cloning. Therefore, it is in the interest of each person to learn more than the fundamentals of biology and genetics in order to make educated choices. In this course we will be concerned with the traditional concepts of human genetics including pedigree analysis, linkage mapping, Mendelian, multi-locus and complex traits, and genetic testing. However, for the most part, the course will view human genetics through a molecular lens. For example, the molecular basis of pathological conditions such as Huntington's disease, hypercholesterolemia, Fragile-X and others will be examined in detail, as will gene imprinting and imprinting-related abnormalities (e.g. Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes). Comparative genomics will be applied to the study of heritable traits in humans. The structure, function, and evolution of the sex chromosomes will also receive special attention.
