MBA,01/18/2017 - 05/08/2017," Operations Management is a broad and multi-dimensional area. Drawing on the skills and knowledge of a variety of management disciplines --accounting, finance, organizational behavior, marketing --operations management answers the 'how' question for a firm. How will the product be manufactured or delivered? Where? By whom? What level of service is offered? How is performance measured? Operations management is both an art and a science, marrying quantitative and analytical skills with cognitive problem solving and human relations capabilities. Operations Management encompasses the process whereby goods & services are created and delivered, associated systems and tools, and the people who make it all happen. At the most basic level, the operations function is turning inputs (resources in the form of materials, people, or even knowledge) into outputs (a finished good or delivered service). As operations functions utilize the bulk of a firm's resources, efficiency is a key concern for operations managers. Other aspects include measurement, control, and quality. This course will draw upon your previous coursework in a variety of disciplines and apply those skills and theories to operations management decisions.

Why have democratic regimes in Chile and Uruguay consolidated, while Venezuela and Ecuador have experienced a steady erosion of democratic institutions and norms? While some suggest that institutions, culture, or the timing of elections in democratic transitions play dominant roles in explaining these divergent outcomes, others point to the Cold War, neo-imperialism, and the resource curse as factors holding back would-be democracies. This course uses a comparative case study approach to test the major theories of democratic transition, focusing on the experiences of Central and South American countries. Cole.

The selection of the oppression of racism is deliberate. Through the analysis of critical race theory and intersectionality, students will come to understand the reasoning for this initial emphasis. The course begins with an analysis of racism from structural, (social) psychological and applied perspectives. This approach frames the analysis of other forms of oppression. Types of oppression (sexism, classism, homophobia, etc.) are examined in relationship to sociopolitical and economic factors, and historical themes that continue into the present day are identified. The course will explore the costs of oppression to all individuals and its differential impact on individuals in dominant and subordinate positions. The importance of power and the dynamics of domination and subordination in all forms of oppression will be explored.

One is an ecological-developmental approach to human behavior in the social environment, taking a social constructionist perspective, emphasizing the ways in which culture (of large groups and small) and the broader social environment shape human behavior and identity. Concepts of resilience and resistance to oppression are emphasized using frameworks such as empowerment theories, systems theory and human ecology. This course emphasizes micro, meso, and macro level social systems that influence individual behavior, including families, groups, organizations and communities, as well as the larger society within historical and cultural contexts. Particular attention is paid to culture, race, class, gender and sexual orientation as dynamic social constructions that can be sources of both oppression and strength at all levels of social systems. The second area of focus is on current theoretical frameworks to understand the bio-psycho-social-cultural processes that shape human behavior and development of self across the life span. We emphasize the interaction of individuals with their environments as they mutually influence each other, emphasizing cultural diversity and social justice. The application of multiple theoretical perspectives to Social Work practice is emphasized.
